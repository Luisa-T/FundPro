    "Box plots are used in descriptive statistics to show numerical data using their quartiles [1]. When using box plots it is also possible to use lines also called whiskers which are used to indicate variability outside the upper and lower quartiles [1].  Due to this box plots are sometimes also referred to as box-and-whisker plots or box-and-whisker diagramm [1]. Box plots show variation in samples of a statistical population but they do not make any assumptions of the statistical distribution [1]. If there are any outliers they are usually displayed as individual points [1]. Spread and skewness of the data are displayed using spacing between the different boxes [1]. They can be displayed vertically or horizontally and they allow the statistician to visually estimate various L-estimators such as the interquartile range, midhinge, range, mid-range and trimean [1].\n",
    "The simplest box plot the first and third quartile are the ends of the boxes (also called interquartile range), inside the rectangle the median is displayed as a band within and the whiskers display the maximum and minimum [1,2].\n",
    "It is \"a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on the five number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.\" [2] \n",
    "The ends of the whiskers can display numerous data types, such as:\n",
    "\"the minimum and maximum of all of the data[1] (as in figure 2)\n",
    "the lowest datum still within 1.5 IQR of the lower quartile, and the highest datum still within 1.5 IQR of the upper quartile (often called the Tukey boxplot)[2][3][4] (as in figure 3)\n",
    "one standard deviation above and below the mean of the data\n",
    "the 9th percentile and the 91st percentile\n",
    "the 2nd percentile and the 98th percentile.\n",
    "Any data not included between the whiskers should be plotted as an outlier with a dot, small circle, or star, but occasionally this is not done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some box plots include an additional character to represent the mean of the data.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "On some box plots a crosshatch is placed on each whisker, before the end of the whisker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rarely, box plots can be presented with no whiskers at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this variability, it is appropriate to describe the convention being used for the whiskers and outliers in the caption for the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unusual percentiles 2%, 9%, 91%, 98% are sometimes used for whisker cross-hatches and whisker ends to show the seven-number summary. If the data is normally distributed, the locations of the seven marks on the box plot will be equally spaced.\" !!!! rewrite"

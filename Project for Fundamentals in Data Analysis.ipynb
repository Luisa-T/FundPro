    "Box plots are used in descriptive statistics to show numerical data using their quartiles [1]. When using box plots it is also possible to use lines also called whiskers which are used to indicate variability outside the upper and lower quartiles [1].  Due to this box plots are sometimes also referred to as box-and-whisker plots or box-and-whisker diagramms [1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Box plots show the variation in samples of a statistical population but they do not make any assumptions of the statistical distribution [1]. If there are any outliers they are usually displayed as individual points [1]. Spread and skewness of the data are displayed using spacing between the different boxes [1]. They can be displayed vertically or horizontally and they allow the statistician to visually estimate various L-estimators such as the interquartile range, midhinge, range, mid-range and trimean [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest box plot the first and third quartile are the ends of the boxes (also called interquartile range), inside the rectangle the median is displayed as a band within and the whiskers display the maximum and minimum [1,2].\n",
    "It is \"a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on the five number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.\" [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "The ends of the whiskers can display numerous data types, such as:\n",
    "- the maximum and minimum of all of the data[1] \n",
    "- the highest datum still within 1.5 IQR of the upper quartile, and the lowest datum still within 1.5 IQR of the lower quartile (often referred to as the Tukey boxplot) [1]\n",
    "- the standard deviation below and above the mean of the data [1]\n",
    "- the 9th percentile and the 91st percentile\n",
    "- the 2nd percentile and the 98th percentile.\n",
    "- anything outside of the whiskers is an outlier and is often displayed as a dot, circle, or star [1].\n",
    "- some box plots include an additional character to represent the mean of the data.[2]\n",
    "- Sometimes you can also see a crosshatch placed on each whisker, before the end of the whisker. [2]\n",
    "- Occasionally, box plots may also be displayed without whiskers. [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this variance of use of the box plot it is recommended to describe the convention used for outliers and whiskers in the plot caption. [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "If the data is normally distributed, the unusual percentiles 2%, 9%, 91%, 98% are occasionally used for whisker cross-hatches and whisker ends to display the seven-number summary, then the seven marks are equally spaced on the box plot. [2]"

    "The box plot was first used by the mathematician John W. Tukey in 1969 in order to visually display data [1].\n",

    "- They use less space\n",

    "#### 1. Quartile:\n",
    "\n",
    "The quartile is a type of quantile. The first quartile is describes as the middle number between the median (the second quartile) of the dataset and the smallest number [8]. The third quartile is the value between the highest number in the dataset and the median [8]. It is applied to statistics such as finance, sociology, and epidemiology [8].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. L-estimator: \n",
    "\n",
    "The l-estimator is an estimator, also called L-statistic. This is a linear combination of order statistics of measurements [9]. This can be as many as all points or as little as a single point [9]. L-estimators are beneficial in that they are often robust and extremely simple to use [9]. They are easy to interpret and calculate, and resistant to outliers [9]. Due to these benefits they are useful in robust statitstics such as descriptive statistics, in statistics education and when calculations are difficult [9].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. interquartile range: \n",
    "\n",
    "Also called the midspread or middle 50% in descriptive statistics, the interquartile range is a measure of dispersion. So it is equal to the difference between the upper and lower quartiles or between the 75th and 25th percentiles [10]. The interquartile range is the result of substracting the first from the third quartile [10]. It is usually a robust measure of scale [10].\n",
